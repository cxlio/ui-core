/**
 * Displays an interactive grid list for managing and displaying multiple item elements with support
 * for keyboard-based navigation in all four directions (up, down, left, right), focus management, and selection tracking.
 *
 * Navigation between grid cells is handled through arrow keys, allowing users to move efficiently
 * across the grid without losing focus context.
 *
 * The component maintains correct focus order, skipping hidden elements, and ensures that only one item is focusable
 * at a time by updating the `tabIndex` properties as needed. When there is no selected item,
 * the first item becomes focusable by default.
 *
 * Items are dynamically registered and ordered inside the grid to preserve correct tab flow and alignment.
 * The component handles focus movement for both linear (row) and columnar (up/down) navigation, ensuring
 * that movement is consistent with both LTR and RTL layouts.
 *
 * Consumers can programmatically invoke `.focus()` on the component to set focus to the currently selected item,
 * or the first item if none are selected.
 * It is expected that `ItemBase` elements in `items` implement `focus()` and maintain a `selected` state.
 *
 * The component exposes all item elements through the `items` readonly property for additional manipulation if required.
